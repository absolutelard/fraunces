# type-single-page
 
This project is meant to highlight the versatility of the font I chose. In this case, Fraunces, a font that reminds me heavily of 70's and 80's advertising thus the orange and cream theme of the webpage. When designing this webpage, I wanted to initially make it sort of poppy and vibrant but I ended up sticking with a simpler design. The font itself is so fun and creative, and I wanted to convey that without taking away from the font itself, so I decided to focus mainly on the font rather than the outer visuals themselves. 

The biggest challenge I faced during this project was motivation. Kinda ran out towards the finish line so a lot of my ideas did not come to fruition on the main page. However, I still had fun towards the beginning of the project regarding design ideas and layout. It's always an interesting challenge working with new tools and new programs.
