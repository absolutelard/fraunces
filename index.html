            <h1>History of the font</h1>
                <p>
                  Fraunces is an “Old Style” typeface designed by the team at Undercase Type. It was a design challenge presented to the team by google to create a display typeface. They were struck by how there wasnt much of a “wonky” feel to any of the fonts and decided to fill that gap. They were inspired by fonts such as Cooper Black, Windsor and Souvenir. These fonts personified the “wonky” feel that the team at Undercase Type was attempting to achieve with this incredibly playful yet simultaneously refined font. Due to its versatility as a variable font, it can transform from a playful, creative font to a more refined and classical look. Its versatility presents the creator with the ability to shift from one tone to another seamlessly within the same font.                </p>
